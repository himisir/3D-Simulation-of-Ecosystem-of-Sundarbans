# 3D-Simulation-of-Ecosystem-of-Sundarbans
An early playable version can be found in [here](https://himisir.itch.io/ecosim-3d)

Predator prey based model of the Sundarbans.
Go to fullscreen mode for the best experience. It has a WASD camera control. Hold down the right mouse button to look around. The "Simulate" button starts a simulation with the default configuration value.Users can customize their environment by using the "Configure" button. Since each field's default value is zero, all of them must be filled out for the system to work as intended. The simulation runs longer when the life span is higher and the pregnancy period is shorter. The Time Scale Slider allows you to accelerate the simulation. If the timescale is set too high, simulation can behave strangely.
