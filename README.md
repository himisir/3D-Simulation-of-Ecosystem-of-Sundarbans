# 3D-Simulation-of-Ecosystem-of-Sundarbans-

Predator prey based model of the Sundarbans

Set the initial population of predator and prey species in Simulation Manager and run the simulation.
Indivisual properties of predator or prey species can be changed by predator and prey prefabs.

For the best experience, switch to fullscreen mode. 

It includes a WASD camera control. Hold down the right mouse click to look around.

The "Simulate" button will start a simulation with the default configuration value. 

The "Configure" button allows users to set up an environment of their own. The default value of each field is zero, therefore every field must be filled in order to function properly. A higher life span with a lower pregnancy period helps the simulation run longer. 

The Time Scale Slider allows you to fasten up the simulation. Simulation can behave oddly if the timescale is set too high.
